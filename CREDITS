Sixplz is a PHP extension that uses fastlz from Ariya Hidayat
(http://www.fastlz.org) to compress data and the 6pack/6unpack
utils to handle and ensure data consistency.

It is inspired from php-fastlz extension from t4rmin4t0r
(https://github.com/t3rmin4t0r/php-fastlz) and its fork from iliaal
(https://github.com/iliaal/php-fastlz)
